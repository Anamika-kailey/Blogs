#  Building the "Choose Template" and "Preview Template" Pages â€“ Resume Builder Web App Progress
Today was a productive day in the development of my Resume Builder Web App! I focused on designing and implementing two key features that enhance the user experience:

## Features Completed
**1. Choose Template Page**

This page allows users to select from a range of professionally designed resume templates. Each template is displayed as a visual card or thumbnail to make the selection process intuitive and user-friendly.

**âœ… Key Highlights:**

Grid layout using Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive template display.

Hover effects to preview or highlight templates.

Click-to-select functionality to choose a template.

Responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop.

ðŸ§  Goal: Make the template selection visually appealing and simple so users can quickly choose a style that suits their profession or preferences.

**2. Preview Template Page**

Once a user selects a template, they are taken to a Preview Page to see how their resume would look in that format. This gives them confidence before proceeding to edit or finalize the content.

**âœ… Key Highlights:**

Full-screen template preview rendered using dynamic data placeholders.

Option to go back and choose a different template.

## Tech Stack Used
Next.js (App Router) â€“ for routing between pages.

Tailwind CSS â€“ for fast, responsive UI styling.

React Context / Zustand (optional) â€“ to manage selected template and resume state globally.
