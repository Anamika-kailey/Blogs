# Mastering Routing in Next.js: Routing, Nested Routes, Dynamic Routes, and Layouts
Next.js is a powerful React framework that offers a robust file-system-based routing mechanism out of the box. Today, I deep-dived into some essential routing concepts in Next.js including routing, nested routes, dynamic routes, nested dynamic routes, and layouts (including nested layouts). Here's everything I learned, broken down in a beginner-friendly manner.

## Basic Routing in Next.js
Next.js uses a file-based routing system. Every file inside the pages/ directory automatically becomes a route.

✅ Example:

/pages
  └── about.js    ➝ /about
  └── contact.js  ➝ /contact
If you create a file called about.js, you can access it directly at http://localhost:3000/about.

🧩 Nested Routes
You can create sub-routes by nesting folders and files inside the pages directory.

✅ Example:

/pages
  └── blog/
        └── index.js     ➝ /blog  
        └── post.js      ➝ /blog/post
        
This structure gives you URLs like /blog and /blog/post.

## Dynamic Routes
Dynamic routing allows you to capture values from the URL and use them as parameters inside your page.

✅ Syntax:
Use square brackets [param] to denote a dynamic segment.

/pages
  └── blog/
        └── [slug].js   ➝ /blog/my-first-post
Inside [slug].js, you can use useRouter() or getStaticProps/getServerSideProps to access slug.

## Nested Dynamic Routes
You can combine folders and dynamic segments to create deeply nested dynamic routes.

✅ Example:

/pages
  └── blog/
        └── [category]/
              └── [slug].js   ➝ /blog/javascript/nextjs-routing
This supports a URL like /blog/javascript/nextjs-routing, capturing both category and slug.

## Layouts in Next.js (App Router)
With the App Router (app/ directory), you can define layouts that persist across different routes.

### Basic Layout
Create a layout.js inside a route folder to wrap all its children.

/app
  └── about/
        └── layout.js
        └── page.js
The layout.js will wrap the page.js and all other nested pages under /about.

### Nested Layouts
Layouts can be nested for different route segments.

/app
  └── dashboard/
        └── layout.js       ➝ Dashboard layout
        └── analytics/
              └── page.js   ➝ Uses both dashboard and root layout
              
Each route can have its own layout while still being wrapped by the parent layout.
