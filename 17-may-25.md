# Building an Onboarding Flow in Next.js: Personal & Educational Details Components
Today, I started working on an onboarding flow for my Resume Builder project using Next.js (App Router) and Tailwind CSS. The goal was to collect user data step-by-step, starting with Personal Details and Educational Details.

In this blog post, I’ll walk through what I built, how I structured my components, and what I learned along the way.
## Routing with App Router
Inside /app/onboarding/page.jsx, I created the main layout that includes:

A Stepper to show progress.

A state variable to manage which form step is currently visible.

## Personal Details Component
This step is designed to collect basic user information such as:

Full Name

Email Address

Phone Number

The component includes a form that validates input and moves to the next step upon submission.

## Educational Details Component
In this step, the user is asked to enter academic qualifications:

Degree

College/University Name

Graduation Year

This form also typically includes navigation buttons — a "Back" button to return to the previous step and a "Next" button to continue.

## Stepper
The Stepper visually represents the current position in the onboarding process, improving clarity and engagement.

## Key Learnings
Through this exercise, I gained a solid understanding of:

Building multi-step forms using state.

Designing components that handle form logic and transitions.

Keeping UI consistent with shared layout components like Navbar and Stepper.

Structuring a Next.js project for modular development.
