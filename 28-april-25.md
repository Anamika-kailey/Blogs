# Building a Password Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Today, I completed a fun and practical project — a Password Generator!
In this blog, I’ll walk you through what I built, how I approached it, and what I learned.

##  Project Overview
The goal of the project was to create a simple web-based Password Generator that allows users to:

Set the desired password length.

Choose if they want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Generate a strong random password with a single click.

Easily copy the password for use.

Added a strength indicator (Weak, Medium, Strong).

## How It Works
### HTML Structure:

I created input fields for password length selection.

Checkboxes to choose character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

A button to generate the password and another to copy it.

### CSS Styling:

I designed a clean and simple user interface.

Added hover effects to buttons for better UX.

## JavaScript Functionality:

Wrote functions to randomly pick characters from selected sets.

Built logic to combine user preferences (like 12-character password with numbers and symbols).

Made sure passwords were securely randomized.

Implemented copy-to-clipboard functionality for easy use.

## What I Learned
Practiced DOM manipulation by dynamically updating the page.

Strengthened my understanding of randomization in JavaScript.

Improved event handling using click listeners.

Made the UI more user-friendly using CSS transitions.
