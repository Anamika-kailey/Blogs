# Understanding Web Storage: A Beginner‚Äôs Guide
Today, I explored one of the essential topics for modern web development‚ÄîWeb Storage. Whether you're building a portfolio, a resume builder, or a full-scale application, understanding how to store data in the browser is crucial for improving performance and user experience.

Let‚Äôs dive into what I learned!

## üß† What is Web Storage?
Web Storage provides a way to store key-value pairs in a user's browser. Unlike cookies, it doesn‚Äôt get sent with every HTTP request and offers more space to store data.

There are two main types of Web Storage:

Local Storage

Session Storage

### üóÉÔ∏è 1. Local Storage
Persists even after the browser is closed.

Ideal for storing data you want to keep across sessions (like user preferences or saved resumes).

Syntax:

**// Save data**

localStorage.setItem("name", "John");

**// Retrieve data**

const name = localStorage.getItem("name");

**// Remove item**

localStorage.removeItem("name");

**// Clear all**

localStorage.clear();

### ‚è≥ 2. Session Storage
Cleared when the tab is closed.

Good for temporary data like a session token or onboarding steps.

Syntax is similar:

sessionStorage.setItem("step", "1");

const step = sessionStorage.getItem("step");

sessionStorage.removeItem("step");

sessionStorage.clear();

### üç™ 3. Cookie Storage
Sent with every HTTP request to the server (unless marked as HttpOnly).

Size limit is around 4KB.

Can be configured with attributes like expiration, domain, path, secure, and HttpOnly.

Useful for:

Authentication tokens

Session tracking

Server-side reads

Example (in JavaScript):

**// Set a cookie**

document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT; path=/";

**// Read cookies**

console.log(document.cookie);

**// Delete cookie (set past expiry date)**

document.cookie = "username=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";

‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid storing sensitive data in cookies unless they are encrypted and marked as HttpOnly.

### üîê When Not to Use Web Storage
While it‚Äôs useful, Web Storage should not be used for sensitive information like passwords or authentication tokens, especially in production apps. It‚Äôs accessible through JavaScript and vulnerable to XSS attacks.
