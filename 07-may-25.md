 # Learning JWT Authentication & MongoDB

##  JWT Auth Flow
Hereâ€™s the basic flow of how JWT authentication works:

User logs in with credentials.

Server validates credentials and generates a JWT.

JWT is sent back to the client (browser/app).

Client stores the token (usually in localStorage or cookies).

For protected routes, client sends token in headers (usually in Authorization: Bearer <token>).

Server verifies token and grants/denies access.

## Middleware
Whenever a request is made to your server, it goes through a pipeline of middleware functions. Each middleware can:

Modify the request or response

End the request-response cycle

Call next() to pass control to the next middleware


## How I Implemented JWT Auth
I used Node.js with Express.js for the backend. Here's a breakdown:
### Install Required Packages

npm install express jsonwebtoken bcryptjs dotenv

### Set Up Express Server

###  Create a Login Route

### Protect Routes with Middleware

### Create a Protected Route

## MONGODB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB doesn't require predefined schemas, making it ideal for modern applications that deal with dynamic data.

## Key Features
Document-based: Data is stored as documents (objects) in collections, similar to how JavaScript stores objects.

Schema-less: You can store different fields and data types in different documents.

Scalable: Built for high availability and horizontal scaling.

Flexible Queries: Rich and powerful query language for filtering, updating, and aggregating data.
