# Understanding JavaScript Fundamentals:
Today, I explored some of the essential fundamentals, including conditional branching, logical operators, the Nullish coalescing operator, loops, switch statements, and functions.
## Conditional Branching
Conditional branching is a fundamental programming construct that allows a program to make decisions based on given conditions. JavaScript provides the if, else if, and else statements to execute specific code blocks depending on whether a condition evaluates to true or false.

## Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values, allowing multiple conditions to be combined or negated. JavaScript provides three primary logical operators:

&& (AND) – Returns true if both conditions are true.

|| (OR) – Returns true if at least one condition is true.

! (NOT) – Inverts the Boolean value of a condition.

## Nullish Coalescing Operator (??)
The Nullish coalescing operator (??) is a relatively new addition to JavaScript that helps in handling null and undefined values. It provides a default value when the left-hand operand is null or undefined.

## Loops
Loops are control structures that allow code to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. JavaScript provides several types of loops:

for Loop – Iterates over a sequence of numbers or elements.

while Loop – Executes as long as a specified condition remains true.

do...while Loop – Executes at least once before checking the condition.

## Switch Statements
A switch statement provides an alternative to multiple if-else conditions by evaluating a variable against multiple possible values. Each case represents a possible value, and execution jumps to the matching case.

##  Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. JavaScript supports various function types, including:

Function Declarations – Named functions that can be used before their definition.

Function Expressions – Anonymous functions stored in variables.
