# Getting Started with Next.js and Tailwind CSS:
Today I began my journey into Next.js and Tailwind CSS — two powerful tools for modern web development. In this blog, I’ll walk through the basics I learned, including what Next.js is, how its folder structure works, and how Tailwind CSS integrates with it for efficient styling.

## What is Next.js?
Next.js is a React framework that simplifies building full-stack applications. It offers features like:

**Server-side rendering (SSR)**

**Static site generation (SSG)**

**API routes**

**Image optimization**

**File-based routing**

It allows developers to focus more on building features rather than setting up configurations.

## Understanding Next.js Folder Structure
Once you create a Next.js app using:

npx create-next-app@latest my-app
You’ll notice a few important folders and files:

**1. /pages**
This is the most critical folder. Each .js file becomes a route. For example:

pages/index.js → /

pages/about.js → /about

You can even nest routes using subfolders.

**2. /public**
Used for storing static assets like images, icons, fonts, etc.

**3. /styles**
Contains global styles (globals.css) and module-specific styles.

**4. next.config.js**
Used to customize your Next.js configuration.

**5. package.json**
Lists project dependencies and scripts.

## Introduction to Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing custom styles in a CSS file, you use utility classes directly in your HTML or JSX.

Example:

<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>

## Setting Up Tailwind CSS in Next.js
**To install Tailwind in your Next.js app:**

npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init -p

**Then, update your tailwind.config.js:**

content: [

  "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",

],

**Add the Tailwind directives to your globals.css:**

@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;

Now you can start using Tailwind classes in your components.

**or**
you can use the tailwind at the time of creating next app
