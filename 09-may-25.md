# Continue building resume templates
As part of my journey in web development and template design, I recently completed three customizable resume templates using HTML and Jinja2 templating engine. This project not only helped me strengthen my front-end development skills but also deepened my understanding of templating with Jinja2, which is commonly used in Flask and other Python-based web frameworks.

## Why I Chose Jinja2
Jinja2 is a powerful templating language for Python, allowing for dynamic content rendering with clean and maintainable syntax. By combining Jinja2 with HTML, I was able to:

Use loops and conditionals for dynamic sections like experience, skills, and education.

Create reusable components such as headers, footers, and sections.

Easily switch data using JSON or Python dictionaries to generate multiple resumes with the same layout.

## What I Built
**1. Modern Professional Template**
Clean layout with a two-column design.

Highlights contact info, summary, skills, and experience.

Good fit for tech and design professionals.

**2. Classic Elegant Template**
Simple and structured layout.

Uses serif fonts for a more traditional, formal look.

Ideal for academia, law, or business profiles.

**3. Creative Grid-Based Template**
Uses a creative card-like layout for each resume section.

Great for showcasing portfolios and creative project-based work.

## Tech Stack
HTML5 for the structure.

Jinja2 for templating and rendering dynamic data.

CSS for styling.

## Key Takeaways
Learned how to separate data from layout using templating.

Practiced creating reusable components and template inheritance.

Gained more experience preparing web content for PDF export and printing.
