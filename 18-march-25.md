# Completed Crew pages and started Technology pages of space tourism multipage website
Today, I made significant progress on the space tourism website by working on the Crew and Technology pages. These sections play a crucial role in enhancing user engagement and providing essential information about the space journey.
## Crew Page Development
The Crew page is designed to introduce the astronauts and experts responsible for the space mission. The following elements were added:

### Crew Images:
High-quality images of each crew member were carefully selected and displayed prominently.

### Names and Professions:
Each crew memberâ€™s name and their specific role in the mission (e.g., Commander, Pilot, Engineer) were included.

### Descriptions:
A brief bio for each member was added to highlight their experience and contributions to the mission.

## Technology Page Development
I also started working on the Technology page, which will provide details about the innovative technology used in space travel. 

Responsive design techniques were implemented to make the page accessible on different devices. Flexbox and CSS Grid were used to create a dynamic layout, ensuring that images and text adjust smoothly across various screen sizes.
