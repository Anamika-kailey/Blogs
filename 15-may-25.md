# Getting Started with Tailwind CSS in Next.js: Building a Sign-Up and Login Page
Today, I dove into integrating Tailwind CSS with Next.js and created authentication pages—a Sign Up and Login page—as part of my learning journey into modern frontend development.
## Setting Up Tailwind CSS in Next.js
To get started, I followed these steps:

### Initialize a Next.js Project

npx create-next-app@latest auth-tailwind-app

cd auth-tailwind-app

### Install Tailwind CSS
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer

npx tailwindcss init -p

### Configure Tailwind
In tailwind.config.js, I added:

content: [
  
  "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  
  "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",

],
### Include Tailwind in CSS

In styles/globals.css:

@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;

Now Tailwind CSS is ready to use!

## Creating Sign-Up and Login Pages
I created two files inside the pages/ directory:

login/page.jsx

signup/page.js
