# Finalizing the Space Tourism Website: Technology Page & Hover Effects
Today marks the completion of my space tourism website project! I wrapped up the development by finalizing the Technology page, enhancing the overall user experience with hover effects, and ensuring the site is fully responsive.

## Technology Page Completion

The Technology page was successfully built with essential details about the advanced systems used in space travel. The following elements were added:

A High-Quality Image: A visually appealing image representing space technology to create an engaging experience.

Informative Text: A detailed description of spacecraft specifications & technologies.

Responsive Layout: Ensuring that the page adapts well to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries.

## Adding Hover Effects for a Dynamic Experience
To enhance the interactivity of the website, I implemented hover effects across all pages. These effects were applied to:

Links: Smooth transitions and color changes when hovered over.

Text Elements: Slight animations and color shifts to improve readability and aesthetics.

With the Technology page complete and hover effects added, the entire website is now fully functional and visually appealing. The project includes:

A Home Page with an engaging introduction.
A Destination Page with different destinations to travel.
A Crew Page showcasing the astronauts and their roles.
A Technology Page highlighting innovations in space travel.
