# Creating Flyo dark theme Landing Page
Creating a visually appealing and user-friendly landing page is an essential skill for web designers. Today, I embarked on an exciting project: designing a Flyo dark theme landing page using HTML and CSS. This project focuses on building various UI components, including quotes, callouts, testimonials, feature blocks, buttons, and inputs.
## Components of the Landing Page
### Callouts
Quotes and callouts play a crucial role in emphasizing key messages. They help in breaking the monotony of plain text while highlighting user testimonials, inspirational messages, or product benefits.
### Testimonials
A landing page is incomplete without social proof. Adding testimonials boosts credibility by showcasing real user experiences. The challenge lies in designing them to be visually appealing yet easy to read.
### Feature Blocks
Feature blocks help present the core functionalities of a product or service. Using proper spacing, alignment, and icons ensures clarity and a clean design.
### Buttons & Inputs
Buttons and inputs define user interactions. A dark theme requires careful attention to contrast so that buttons remain clickable and inputs are legible. The choice of hover effects and animations adds to the overall user experience.
