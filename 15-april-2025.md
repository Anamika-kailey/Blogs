#  Deep Dive into Advanced JavaScript: Classes, Inheritance, and More
As I continue my JavaScript journey, today's focus was all about diving deeper into the object-oriented side of the language. From class inheritance to mixins, here's a breakdown of the key concepts I explored.

## Class Inheritance
JavaScript allows classes to inherit from other classes using the extends keyword. This enables code reuse and makes it easier to manage shared behavior.Inheritance promotes code reuse. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, we define a base (or parent) class and then create child classes that extend it. 

class Animal {

  speak() {

    console.log("Animal speaks");
  
  }

}

class Dog extends Animal {

  bark() {
  
    console.log("Dog barks");
  
  }

}

const d = new Dog();

d.speak(); // Animal speaks

d.bark();  // Dog barks

## Static Properties and Methods
Static methods and properties are defined on the class itself, not on its instances. They are commonly used for utility functions or constants that are not tied to a specific instance.

class Calculator {

  static PI = 3.14;

  static add(a, b) {

    return a + b;
  
  }

}

console.log(Calculator.PI); 

console.log(Calculator.add(5, 3));

A static method cannot be called on an instance of the class—it must be called on the class itself.Using static members helps keep our code clean and logically organized, especially when working with shared operations.

## Private and Protected Properties
Private class members are denoted by # and cannot be accessed outside the class.

While JavaScript doesn't have true "protected" access, developers simulate it using naming conventions like _property.

## instanceof Operator
The instanceof keyword checks whether an object is an instance of a class or constructor function.

console.log(dog instanceof Dog);

## Mixins
Mixins are a way to add reusable behavior to classes without using inheritance. They’re like plugins for your classes.nlike some other languages, JavaScript does not support multiple inheritance (where a class can inherit from more than one parent). However, mixins provide a powerful alternative.
