# Building Resume Templates with Jinja2 and HTML
Creating a personalized resume is one of the most important steps in showcasing your skills, projects, and experience. Recently, I dove into building dynamic resume templates using Jinja2 and HTML, and in this blog, I’ll walk you through the process, my learnings, and how you can create reusable and dynamic resumes too!

## what is Jinja2?
Jinja2 is a templating engine for Python, commonly used with web frameworks like Flask. It allows you to generate dynamic HTML content by injecting variables, loops, and logic directly into the HTML file. This makes it perfect for generating resumes that may change based on input like user data or different templates.

## Project Setup
Here’s what I used:

HTML – for building the structure of the resume

Jinja2 – for templating and injecting data

Python – to render the template

### Creating the Resume Template (Jinja2 + HTML)
Jinja2 is powerful for generating reusable, dynamic documents.

### Rendering with Python
Create a simple Python script to load data and render the resume

### JSON (data.json)
Data provide in the form of JSON.

### styling Your Resume
Interal css is used for styling.

## Key Learnings
Jinja2 is powerful for generating reusable, dynamic documents.

Creating resume templates with logic is much easier than static HTML.
