#  Learning Next.js: Core Concepts 
Next.js is a powerful React framework for building modern web applications. Whether you're creating a portfolio, a blog, or a full-stack SaaS product, mastering the core features of Next.js is essential. In this blog post, I’ll walk through what I’ve learned so far — from image optimization to data handling and error boundaries.

## Image Optimization in Next.js
Next.js comes with a built-in <Image /> component that helps with automatic image optimization. Instead of using the standard <img> tag, use this component to load images efficiently.

**Size optimization:** Automatically serving correctly sized images for each device, using modern image formats like WebP.

**Visual stability:** Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.

**Faster page loads:** Only loading images when they enter the viewport using native browser lazy loading, with optional blur-up placeholders.

**Asset flexibility:** Resizing images on-demand, even images stored on remote servers

## Using Custom Fonts in Next.js
With the App Router, Next.js makes using fonts from Google or locally much easier.
**Google fonts**
You can automatically self-host any Google Font. Fonts are included stored as static assets and served from the same domain as your deployment, meaning no requests are sent to Google by the browser when the user visits your site.

**Local fonts**
To use a local font, import your font from next/font/local and specify the src of your local font file. Fonts can be stored in the public folder.

## Styling with CSS in Next.js
Next.js supports multiple CSS approaches:

CSS Modules: Scoped styles per component.

Tailwind CSS: Utility-first framework.

Styled Components: For CSS-in-JS lovers.

## Fetching Data in Next.js
You can fetch data in Server Components using:

**With the fetch API**
To fetch data with the fetch API, turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the fetch call.

**With an ORM or database**
Since Server Components are rendered on the server, you can safely make database queries using an ORM or database client. 

### Updating Data (Client Side)
For updating data (e.g., submitting forms), use fetch() or libraries like Axios on the client side.

## How to handle errors
**Handling expected errors**
Expected errors are those that can occur during the normal operation of the application, such as those from server-side form validation or failed requests. These errors should be handled explicitly and returned to the client.

Server Functions:
You can use the useActionState hook to handle expected errors in Server Functions.

Server Components:
When fetching data inside of a Server Component, you can use the response to conditionally render an error message or redirect.

Not found:
You can call the notFound function within a route segment and use the not-found.js file to show a 404 UI.
