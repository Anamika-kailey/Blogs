# Building the Landing Page for My Resume Builder App with Next.js
Today, I took a major step forward in my Resume Builder project — I designed and developed the landing page using Next.js. This page serves as the first impression of the application, welcoming users and introducing them to the key features and benefits of the platform.

## Objective
The goal of the landing page is to:

Attract users with a clean and professional design

Explain the purpose and features of the resume builder

Provide clear navigation to login or sign up

Deliver a fast and responsive user experience

## Tech Stack Used
Next.js: For creating a fast, SEO-optimized, and scalable React-based application.

Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling and rapid UI development.

Responsive Design: Ensuring accessibility across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Page Structure
The landing page is structured into several key sections:

**Navbar:**

Contains the site logo and navigation links ( Login, Sign Up).

Responsive hamburger menu for smaller screens.

**Hero Section:**

A catchy headline and short description of what the app does.

A prominent “Get Started” button that leads to onboarding or signup.
