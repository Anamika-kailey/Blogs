# Building a Watch Landing Page Using HTML and CSS
## Setting Up the Project
Before we begin, create a project folder and organize it with necessary files, including an HTML file for structure, a CSS file for styling, and an images folder for product visuals.
## Structuring the Landing Page
The landing page should include key sections:
A header with a brand logo and navigation menu.
### 
A hero section with a compelling tagline, description, and a high-quality image of the watch.
###
A features section highlighting the craftsmanship, durability, and innovative design of the watch.
## Designing with CSS
The design should focus on:
###
A clean and modern layout with a visually appealing color scheme.
###
Responsive styling to ensure the page looks great on all devices.
###
Elegant typography and properly spaced elements to enhance readability.
###
A professional image of the watch placed prominently to attract attention.
## Adding Responsiveness
To ensure the landing page adapts well to different screen sizes:
###
Use flexbox or CSS grid to create a flexible layout that adjusts dynamically.
###
Apply media queries to modify styles based on screen width, ensuring mobile-friendly design.

# Trying to resolve Deployment issue on netlify
I'm troubleshooting a Netlify deployment issue by checking for case-sensitive file paths, ensuring all necessary files are committed, and verifying the build command and publish directory settings. I also cleared the cache, reviewed the Netlify logs for errors, and ensured all dependencies are properly installed.
