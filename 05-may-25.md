# Understanding JWT Authentication: A Complete Guide
## Introduction to JWT Authentication
WT is a compact, URL-safe token format that allows you to securely transmit information between two parties. It is commonly used in authentication mechanisms for APIs and web applications.

## What is JWT?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties. JWTs are typically used for authentication and information exchange in a way that is both secure and efficient.

A JWT typically contains the following components:

Header: Specifies the algorithm used to sign the token (e.g., HMAC SHA256 or RSA).

Payload: Contains the claims (information about the user or session), such as user ID or expiration time.

Signature: Used to verify that the token was not altered and that it was issued by a trusted source.

**e.g.** - eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c

## Components of a JWT Token
### 1. Header
The header typically consists of two parts:

Algorithm (alg): This specifies the algorithm used to sign the token. Common algorithms include HS256, RS256, etc.

Token Type (typ): Usually, this is "JWT".

### 2. Payload
The payload contains claims about the user or session. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. There are three types of claims:

Registered Claims: Predefined claims that are recommended for use, such as iss (issuer), exp (expiration time), sub (subject), etc.

Public Claims: Claims that can be defined freely by those using JWT.

Private Claims: Custom claims shared between parties that agree on their meaning.

### 3. Signature
To create the signature, you need:

The encoded header

The encoded payload

A secret key (using HMAC algorithm) or a private key (using RSA or ECDSA)

## How Does JWT Authentication Work?
1. User Login
2. Token Issuance
3. Making Requests with JWT
4. Server Verifies the Token
5. Token Expiration and Refresh

## Why Use JWT?
1. Stateless Authentication
2. Cross-Domain Authentication
3. Security
4. Flexibity

## JWT vs. Sessions
JWT has several advantages over traditional session-based authentication:

Scalability: With session-based authentication, session data is stored on the server, which can become a bottleneck in distributed systems. With JWT, since the token contains all the necessary information, the server doesnâ€™t need to maintain session states.

Cross-Domain: JWT can be easily used across different domains or services, while sessions typically require a shared session store.
