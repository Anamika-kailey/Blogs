# Exploring Advanced JavaScript Concepts: Optional Chaining, Symbol, Object-to-Primitive Conversion, and More
## Optional Chaining (?.)
Optional chaining (?.) is a feature introduced in ES2020 that simplifies access to deeply nested object properties. It ensures that if a property does not exist, JavaScript does not throw an error but instead returns undefined.

In traditional JavaScript, accessing a deeply nested property requires multiple checks using conditional statements or logical operators. Without these checks, attempting to access a non-existent property could result in a runtime error.

Optional chaining (?.) is used when accessing properties of an object that may not exist. If a property is undefined or null, the expression short-circuits and evaluates to undefined rather than throwing an error.

## Symbol Type
The Symbol type was introduced in ES6 as a primitive data type that represents unique identifiers. Unlike strings, symbols are always unique, even if they have the same description.

JavaScript objects use string keys for properties, which can sometimes lead to conflicts when multiple parts of a program modify the same object. Symbols help avoid property name collisions by ensuring that each symbol-based key is unique.

## Object-to-Primitive Conversion
JavaScript allows objects to be converted into primitive values when necessary, such as when performing arithmetic operations or string concatenations. This is done using type coercion mechanisms that rely on predefined methods.
How JavaScript Converts Objects to Primitives
There are three main ways an object can be converted into a primitive:

toString() Method: Converts an object into a string representation.

valueOf() Method: Returns a primitive value (typically a number) when used in arithmetic operations.

Symbol.toPrimitive Method: A special method that allows fine control over the conversion process.

## Methods of primitives
JavaScript allows us to work with primitives (strings, numbers, etc.) as if they were objects. They also provide methods to call as such. We will study those soon, but first we’ll see how it works because, of course, primitives are not objects (and here we will make it even clearer).

Let’s look at the key distinctions between primitives and objects.

A primitive

Is a value of a primitive type.
There are 7 primitive types: string, number, bigint, boolean, symbol, null and undefined.
An object

Is capable of storing multiple values as properties.
Can be created with {}, for instance: {name: "John", age: 30}. There are other kinds of objects in JavaScript: functions, for example, are objects.

## Numbers
JavaScript has a Number type that includes methods for mathematical operations and formatting.

Common Number Methods:
toFixed(n) – Rounds a number to n decimal places.

toString(base) – Converts a number to a string in a different numeral system (e.g., binary, octal, hexadecimal).

isInteger(value) – Checks if a value is an integer.
