# Building a Space Tourism Website
## Setting the Background with a Stunning Space Image
The background of a space tourism website should capture the beauty and mystery of space. To achieve this, used a high-quality space-themed image to create an immersive experience. A dark, star-filled background image used that conveys depth and vastness.
For a seamless effect, ensured the image covered the entire viewport, giving users a full-screen experience that makes them feel as if they are already on a journey beyond Earth.

The properties used: background-image, background-size and other.

## Typography 
Typography plays a significant role in setting the tone of a website. For this project, wanted the fonts to have a futuristic yet readable style. selected a modern, Bellefair serif font for text to maintain clarity. For headings, opted for a bold, space-inspired font that adds a sense of adventure and exploration.
also played with text colors, choosing white and light blue to contrast against the dark background. This enhances readability while reinforcing the futuristic theme.

The properties used: font-size, line-height, font-family etc.

## Creating a Hamburger Menu for Navigation
A hamburger menu is an essential feature, especially for mobile users. Instead of a traditional navigation bar, I designed a minimalistic hamburger icon that, when clicked, opens a sidebar containing the main menu.the sidebar having the blur background.
The sidebar smoothly slides in from the right, revealing navigation links such as:
Home 

Destinations

Crew 

Technology 

The properties used: list are used, list-style,text-decoration, close icon etc.
